  (fsj@csd.cri.dk)

- New -f flag overrides the default database filename.

- New -r flag allows tcpdump save files to be read.

- memcpy() doesn't handle overlapping buffers so use bcopy() instead.
  Reported by Attila Bruncsak (attila.bruncsak@itu.int)

- Have configure determine the sendmail path.

- Don't bother updating hostnames when reading arp.dat since this can
  be expensive in the number of dns requests generated.

- Improve robostness of the aprfetch script.

- Update massagevendor to convert the IEEE public Organizationally
  Unique Identifier (OUI) file format.

- Don't use -e with awk, not all versions support it. Suggested by
  Stephen Thompson (thompson@pobox.upenn.edu)

- Add -n flag (alternate networks) and -N flag (don't report bogons).

- Improve ethernet address parser error checking.

- Convert arp2ethers from csh to sh.

v2.0.2 Sat Jun  7 03:15:03 PDT 1997
